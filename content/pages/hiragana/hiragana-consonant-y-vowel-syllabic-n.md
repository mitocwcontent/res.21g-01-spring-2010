Consonant + y + Vowel
---------------------

The Japanese consonant sounds are combined with the /ya/, /yu/ and /yo/ syllables to form a single contracted syllable. For example, /ki/ and /ya/ combine to form the single syllable /kya/, represented in hiragana as きゃ. See the following chart for the complete list of these contracted syllables.

| Consonant/i/ + /ya/ | Consonant/i/ + /yu/ | Consonant/i/ + /yo/ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| きゃ kya | きゅ kyu | きょ kyo |
| しゃ sya (sha) | しゅ syu (shu) | しょ syo (sho) |
| ちゃ tya (cha) | ちゅ tyu (chu) | ちょ tyo (cho) |
| にゃ nya | にゅ nyu | にょ nyo |
| ひゃ hya | ひゅ hyu | ひょ hyo |
| みゃ mya | みゅ myu | みょ myo |
| りゃ rya | りゅ ryu | りょ ryo 

Note that these contracted syllables are always considered to be one syllable, not two. Compare the two (totally different!) following sounds:

きゃ kya (one syllable)  
きや kiya (two syllables)

Syllabic Consonant /n/
----------------------

When /n/ is followed by another consonant, or if a word ends with /n/, then that /n/ is a syllable in itself, and is written with the symbol ん. In JSL this syllable /n/ is represented as /n/.
