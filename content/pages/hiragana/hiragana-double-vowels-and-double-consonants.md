Double Vowels
-------------

### Double o

When double **o** occurs, the second /o/ syllable is written with hiragana う, instead of お. Thus, for instance, the word **ohayoo** (good morning) is written as おはよう, not as おはよお.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. For instance, the word **ookii** (big) is written as おおきい, instead of おうきい.

### Double e

When double **e** occurs, the second /e/ syllable is written with hiragana い, instead of え. For instance, the phrase **situreesimasu** (excuse me) is written as しつれいします instead of しつれえします.

Again, there are a few exceptions to this rule. For instance, the word **oneesan** (older sister) is written as おねえさん, instead of おねいさん.

Although exceptional cases (for both double **o's** and double **e's** are very few, it is always good to check with your Japanese version of JSL for transcribing those double vowels.

### Other Double Vowels

Other double vowels are simply written as they are pronounced. Examine, for instance, the following:

おかあさん okaasan (mother)  
おいしい oisii (delicious)

You should also be aware that there are many word pairs which look alike except for a repeated vowel in one of them that makes a difference in the meaning. Here are a few examples:

おばさん obasan (aunt) vs. おばあさん obaasan (grandmother)  
おじさん ozisan (uncle) vs. おじいさん oziisan (grandfather)  
にんぎょ ningyo (mermaid) vs. にんぎょう ningyoo (doll)

Double Consonants
-----------------

Whenever double consonants occur (i.e. pp, tt, kk, ss) the first of the pair is always written with a "half size" つ which looks like this: っ. Observe the following examples:

がっこう gakkoo (school)  
にっぽん nippon (Japan)  
ざっし zassi (magazine)  
きって kitte (postal stamp)
